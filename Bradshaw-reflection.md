**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

Branches! I had a general idea and understanding of how to use them. Seeing them work in action with a partner and all of the explanation our guide provided really helped out. 

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

Besides branches, Merge Conflicts were clarified. We defined them last week and were exposed to them as a concept but didn't witness one. It was helpful to create one to understand exactly what they are and how to fix them. 

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

We talked a lot about branches. Besides that, my pair helped answer questions I had about basic commands in the terminal. 

**What still confuses you about Git?**

I'm lightly confused about the git init command. 

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

I had so much fun! I was very nervous about live pairing and how it would work out. Our guide was amazing and the structure of driver / navigator worked really well.
